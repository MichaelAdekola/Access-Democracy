# Access-Democracy
Satisfaction with democracy in Australia has fallen dramatically in the last decade. There are frequent concerns that politicians are often failing to truly represent the interests of their constituents.

The situation is not helped by the fact that the Australian political system is a highly complex beast which seems almost intentionally confusing to the average citizen.

This situation is to provide the people of Australia with a means to easily access information about how their representatives are voting on issues which they consider important.

Access Democracy neatly displays information regarding how members of Federal Parliament have voted on bills related to political topics, such as Healthcare or Immigration. 

The layout of the site has been designed to be easily traversable for those who have little prior knowledge of politics.
